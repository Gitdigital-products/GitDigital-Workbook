Objective

Create and work with branches.

Requirements

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make changes on the branch
3. Merge back to main
4. Handle a simple merge conflict

Solution

```bash
# Setup
mkdir branch-practice && cd branch-practice
git init
echo "Main content" > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# 1. Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# 2. Make changes on feature
echo "Feature addition" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Add feature to file"

# 3. Switch back to main and make conflicting change
git checkout main
echo "Main update" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Update on main"

# 4. Merge feature (will conflict)
git merge feature-branch

# 5. Resolve conflict (edit file.txt to keep both lines)
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Main content
# Main update
# =======
# Main content
# Feature addition
# >>>>>>> feature-branch

# After editing to include both:
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Merge feature branch"

# Clean up
git branch -d feature-branch
