Objective

Learn to interpret different states in Git.

Requirements

1. Create a repository with one committed file
2. Create three files in different states:
   · Modified file (changes not staged)
   · New file (untracked)
   · Staged file (ready to commit)
3. Use git status to see different states
4. Use git diff to see changes

Hints

```bash
# See staged vs unstaged changes:
git diff           # Shows unstaged changes
git diff --staged  # Shows staged changes
```

Solution

```bash
# Setup
mkdir status-exercise && cd status-exercise
git init
echo "Initial content" > file1.txt
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create files in different states
echo "Modified content" > file1.txt        # Modified (not staged)
echo "New file content" > file2.txt        # Untracked
echo "Staged content" > file3.txt
git add file3.txt                          # Staged

# Check status
git status

# See differences
git diff file1.txt
git diff --staged file3.txt

# Clean up
git add file1.txt file2.txt
git commit -m "Add all files"
