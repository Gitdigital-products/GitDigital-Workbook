Create a simple project tracking your learning:

1. Initialize a repo called git-learning-journal
2. Create these files:
   · notes.md - for your personal notes
   · commands.md - for useful commands
   · examples/ - directory for practice files
3. Make at least 3 commits with meaningful messages
4. Create a .gitignore file
5. Push to a new GitHub repository

Common Issues:

```bash
# If you committed wrong email
git commit --amend --reset-author

# Recover deleted file
git checkout -- deleted-file.txt

# View changes before committing
git diff --staged
